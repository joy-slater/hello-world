# hello-world
Just some repository I made because I was following some kind of step-by-step.

In other news, I'm an "adult" who's finally decided it's about time to learn how to code. Really, I want to learn coding so that I can design my own blog, build a new skill that's not arts-related, and potentially, potentially become some kind of "webworker". It's a stretch to imagine right now, but that's part of why I'm here, no?
  Signing Off,
